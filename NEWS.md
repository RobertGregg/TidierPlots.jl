# TidierPlots.jl updates

# v0.5.3 - 2023-11-28
- Bug fix: `labs()` and themes work with piping interface
- Added Chain as dependency and re-export `@chain` - this will make it easier to use the piping interface.

# v0.5.2
- Function-based interface has completely replaced the macro-based interface.
